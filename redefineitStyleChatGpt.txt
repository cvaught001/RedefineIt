Design a RedefineIt-style UI feature called the “Eye UI.”

Purpose:
A minimalist eye icon sits at the top-right corner of the screen. 
Clicking or tapping it toggles visibility of the visual control panel (sliders, presets, options). 
When the panel is hidden, only the glowing eye icon remains. 
When revealed, the panel slides in smoothly with a subtle neon glow and frosted-glass effect.

Design guidelines (RedefineIt Visual Style):
- Background: deep black-blue gradient (#0b0f13 → #101820).
- Glow tones: cyan, magenta, and violet accent lines.
- The eye icon glows softly when active, dim when inactive.
- The toggle animation should feel *kinetic but deliberate* — easing curves that simulate inertia.
- The control panel should have a blurred, glass-like backdrop (`backdrop-filter: blur(6px)`).
- Borders use faint neon outlines with subtle inner glow.
- Font: clean system-ui, small-caps or monospace, bright text on translucent dark.
- Layout: right-aligned floating container with minimal padding and rounded corners.
- Include a hover effect that gently increases glow intensity.
- Motion: smooth transitions (300–500ms ease-in-out) with transform and opacity fade.
- Optional: slight “blink” or pulse when the eye toggles visibility.

Behavior:
- Clicking the eye toggles the `.visible` class on the control panel.
- The panel slides from `translateX(100%)` to `translateX(0)` on show.
- Keyboard shortcut: `E` toggles visibility.
- When hidden, the controls remain in the DOM but visually collapsed.

Tone:
Clean, cinematic, and reactive — part retro console, part modern synth interface. 
Everything should feel engineered, not ornamental.

Deliverable:
Generate fully self-contained HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code 
that implements this toggle UI with all described RedefineIt styling and animations.
