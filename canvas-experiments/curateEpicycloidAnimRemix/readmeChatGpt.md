## Curtate Epicycloid

A **curtate epicycloid** is a fascinating type of curve generated by a point fixed at a distance _less than the radius_ of a small circle as it rolls without slipping along the outside of a larger fixed circle. Unlike the standard epicycloid—where the tracing point lies exactly on the circumference—the curtate version creates loops that do not reach out as far, forming rounded, petal-like lobes that remain closer to the larger circle.

This curve appears in various applications, including **gear design** and **kinematic mechanisms**, where compact, periodic motion is desired. Its shape is governed by both the radii of the two circles and the offset of the tracing point, allowing for diverse and visually rich patterns.

\[
x(t) = (R + r)\cos t - d\cos\left(\frac{R + r}{r}t\right)
\]

\[
y(t) = (R + r)\sin t - d\sin\left(\frac{R + r}{r}t\right)
\]

A curve becomes a whispered performance when we let a single parameter \(t\) conduct its steps.  
Instead of binding \(x\) and \(y\) directly, we score their motion as synchronized phrases in time—each value breathing with the same underlying rhythm.  
Smooth or staccato, the choreography emerges as the parameter sweeps forward.

\[
x = x(t), \quad y = y(t)
\]

Circular pulse? Try \(x(t) = \cos t\), \(y(t) = \sin t\), and watch the orbit evolve into geometry.
