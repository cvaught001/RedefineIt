A vector field is a mathematical representation that assigns a vector to every point in a given region of space. These vectors can represent various physical quantities such as velocity in a fluid flow, the strength and direction of a magnetic or electric field, or even the gradient of a scalar function. In two dimensions, a vector field looks like a grid of arrows, each arrow showing the direction and magnitude of the vector at that point. In three dimensions,
