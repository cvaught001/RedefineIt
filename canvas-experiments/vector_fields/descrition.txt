A vector field is a mathematical tool used to assign a vector to every point in a given space. Imagine placing a tiny arrow at each point on a surface or in space, where the direction and length of the arrow represent a quantity like force, velocity, or magnetic field at that point. Vector fields are essential in physics and engineeringâ€”for example, a wind map showing the direction and strength of wind across a region is a real-world vector field. Mathematically, vector fields help describe how quantities vary over space and are often visualized to understand dynamic systems.
